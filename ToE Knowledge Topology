- Compression Ratio = Knowledge content at level N / content stored from level N+1
- Each level abstracts and condenses details from the one below it.

This hierarchical abstraction topology of the Theory of Everything (ToE) outlines the stratified structure of scientific knowledge from raw empirical data to a singular, unified meta-theoretical principle. At the base lies Level 5, which consists of unprocessed empirical observations including sensor data, experimental results, and case studies—amounting to an immense volume of approximately 10^12 Knowledge Units (KUs). This layer represents the raw input from reality, uncompressed and maximally specific. Above it, Level 4 consolidates this data into specialized scientific theories within distinct domains such as genetics, cognitive science, economics, and sociocultural dynamics. These theories organize and interpret vast data sets but still operate within relatively narrow scopes. Moving upward, Level 3 synthesizes knowledge into intermediate theoretical models that bridge domains, such as computational neuroscience or systems ecology, which interface fundamental physics with complex phenomena. These models retain high fidelity to lower-level theories while offering greater generality and conceptual integration.

Level 2 hosts domain-specific fundamental theories—most notably Quantum Field Theory, General Relativity, the Standard Model of particle physics, and thermodynamics. These theories significantly compress knowledge by abstracting universal laws from immense empirical data, reducing the information scale to around 10^4 KUs. Level 1 moves a step further by proposing grand unifying frameworks such as String Theory or Loop Quantum Gravity, which attempt to reconcile inconsistencies between quantum mechanics and relativity, often drawing on highly abstract mathematical principles. At the apex, Level 0 envisions an ultimate unification—a minimalistic meta-theory potentially expressible in a single equation or set of axioms that encapsulates all natural laws and their interactions. This top-level abstraction is drastically compressed, possibly representing over a trillion-fold reduction from raw observational data, and aims to unify every theoretical structure beneath it. Together, this layered model reveals how scientific knowledge condenses complexity through increasing abstraction, ultimately aspiring toward a singular, coherent understanding of reality.
